The monsoon clouds gathered above the ancient village of Devgarh.

A quiet breeze swept across the dusty fields at dawn.

Meera stepped out of her hut with a brass pot in her hands.

The smell of wet earth filled the air as the first raindrops fell.

She walked toward the old banyan tree near the riverbank.

Birds scattered in excitement as the sky darkened.

A distant thunder echoed through the valley.

The river Sindhu began to swell with fresh rainwater.

Meera knelt beside the river and filled her pot slowly.

She noticed a faint shimmer beneath the surface.

Curious, she leaned closer to the water.

A small glowing orb floated up toward her hand.

She gasped and stepped back instinctively.

The orb hovered before her, pulsing gently.

Meera hesitated before reaching out to touch it.

As her fingertips brushed it, the orb dissolved into light.

A warm sensation spread through her palm.

Symbols appeared briefly on her skin before fading.

She looked around, confused and breathless.

A voice whispered her name from behind.

She turned to see an elderly man dressed in saffron robes.

His eyes gleamed like molten gold.

“You have been chosen,” he said softly.

Meera stepped back again, startled.

The man smiled reassuringly.

“Do not fear, child,” he added.

“That orb is the blessing of the river spirit.”

Meera swallowed hard, unsure what to say.

“Why me?” she asked in a trembling voice.

“Because your heart is unclouded,” he replied.

A sudden burst of lightning illuminated the sky.

The man gestured toward the mountains.

“A storm is coming, greater than this one.”

Meera felt chills run down her spine.

“What must I do?” she whispered.

“Follow the path the river shows you.”

He turned and began walking away.

Meera hurried after him.

But when she reached the bend, he was gone.

Only his footprints remained in the wet soil.

Meera returned home with questions churning in her mind.

Her grandmother noticed the worry on her face.

“What troubles you, child?” she asked.

Meera hesitated before telling her everything.

The old woman’s expression grew serious.

“Our family has long served the river spirit.”

Meera stared at her in disbelief.

“Why didn’t you ever tell me?” she demanded.

“It was not yet your time,” the grandmother said calmly.

Rain drummed heavily against the thatched roof.

The oil lamp flickered in the corner.

“What do the symbols mean?” Meera asked.

“They are ancient markings of protection,” her grandmother replied.

“Protection from what?” Meera pressed.

The old woman looked toward the mountains.

“From the shadow that sleeps beneath the rocks.”

Meera shivered despite the warm air.

“Tomorrow, you will begin your journey,” the grandmother said.

“Journey? Where?”

“To the Temple of Dawn.”

Meera clenched her fists nervously.

She had never left Devgarh before.

Outside, the wind howled fiercely.

A strange cry echoed from the forest.

Meera peered out the window cautiously.

Two glowing eyes watched from the treeline.

She stepped back quickly, heart racing.

Her grandmother rose from her chair.

“It has already begun,” she said gravely.

The creature outside snarled loudly.

Meera grabbed a wooden staff from the corner.

The door rattled as something struck it.

Her grandmother chanted under her breath.

A faint golden barrier appeared around the hut.

The creature hissed in frustration.

Meera’s grip tightened on the staff.

The barrier flickered but held strong.

Rainwashed leaves smeared across the window.

The creature eventually retreated into the shadows.

Meera exhaled in relief.

“What was that?” she asked shakily.

“A scout from the mountain shadow,” the grandmother replied.

Meera sat down heavily.

“Why is it after me?”

“Because it fears what you may become,” said the grandmother.

Meera’s mind raced with fear and uncertainty.

The storm outside grew even stronger.

Lightning split the sky with blinding light.

Thunder shook the hut violently.

Meera closed her eyes, trying to calm herself.

The grandmother placed a comforting hand on her shoulder.

“Courage is born from fear,” she whispered.

Meera nodded faintly.

The storm raged until midnight.

Slowly, the winds began to settle.

Meera finally drifted into restless sleep.

She dreamed of glowing rivers and towering spirits.

Strange symbols floated around her.

A deep voice spoke from the darkness.

“Wake, chosen one.”

Meera jolted awake, sweating.

Dawn light streamed through the window.

The storm had passed.

Birds chirped cautiously in the trees.

Her grandmother handed her a cloth bundle.

“Food and herbs for the journey,” she said.

Meera swallowed nervously.

She stepped outside, feeling the cool morning air.

The village was quiet, still recovering from the storm.

Meera walked toward the riverbank once again.

Mist hovered above the water like a silver blanket.

She knelt and touched the surface gently.

The river responded with a faint shimmer.

A path of light formed across the water.

Meera gasped softly.

“Follow it,” the grandmother said behind her.

Meera turned and hugged her tightly.

“I will return,” she whispered.

The old woman nodded with moist eyes.

Meera stepped onto the glowing path.

The water held her weight like solid ground.

Fish swam beneath her feet in golden trails.

The river guided her toward the eastern forest.

Trees swayed rhythmically as she approached.

A strange warmth filled the air.

Meera heard a distant melody.

She followed the sound deeper into the woods.

The trees formed arches overhead.

Sunlight scattered in vibrant patterns.

She walked cautiously, gripping her staff.

Suddenly, a figure stepped out from behind a tree.

A young man dressed in hunter’s clothes.

“You shouldn’t be here,” he warned.

Meera raised her chin defiantly.

“The river sent me,” she replied.

The hunter’s eyes widened.

“You’re the chosen one,” he whispered.

Meera hesitated before nodding.

“Follow me,” he said urgently.

He led her to a hidden clearing.

A stone altar stood at the center.

Symbols glowed faintly on its surface.

“What is this place?” Meera asked.

“A sanctuary for the river’s protectors,” he answered.

Meera stepped closer to the altar.

Her palm tingled with warmth.

She placed her hand on the stone.

Light surged upward like a fountain.

The hunter shielded his eyes.

Meera stood firm as energy enveloped her.

Visions flashed before her eyes.

A giant serpent coiled beneath the mountains.

Its scales shimmered like night sky.

Its eyes burned with crimson fire.

Meera gasped in fear.

The vision changed suddenly.

She saw herself standing at the mountain peak.

Light radiated from her hands.

The serpent shrank back in agony.

The vision ended abruptly.

Meera stumbled backward, breathless.

The hunter helped steady her.

“What did you see?” he asked softly.

Meera’s voice trembled.

“A serpent… a great darkness.”

The hunter nodded grimly.

“It has awakened.”

Meera pressed a hand to her chest.

“How do I stop it?”

“By reaching the Temple of Dawn,” he replied.

Meera took a deep breath.

“Then I must continue.”

The hunter bowed respectfully.

“May the river guide you.”

Meera left the clearing with renewed determination.

She walked for hours through the forest.

The light path faded behind her.

She followed the mountain trail ahead.

Rocks crunched under her sandals.

A cold wind swept down from the peaks.

Meera tightened her shawl.

The trail grew steeper.

Her legs ached but she pushed forward.

A shadow passed overhead.

Meera looked up to see a giant bird circling.

Its wings glowed with blue fire.

She froze as it descended.

The bird landed gently before her.

A soft voice echoed in her mind.

“Do not fear, child.”

Meera stared in awe.

The bird lowered its head.

“I guard the Temple of Dawn.”

Meera felt hope rise within her.

“Will you help me?” she asked.

“If your heart remains steady,” the bird replied.

It extended a wing toward her.

Meera climbed onto its back carefully.

The bird soared into the sky.

Wind whipped through Meera’s hair.

The forest shrank beneath them.

Clouds brushed against her face.

The air grew colder as they ascended.

Mountains stretched endlessly around them.

The bird glided gracefully toward a golden peak.

A radiant structure emerged from the mist.

The Temple of Dawn glowed like a rising sun.

Meera gasped at its beauty.

The bird landed on a stone platform.

Meera stepped down slowly.

The air was warm despite the altitude.

Golden light filled the courtyard.

She walked toward the temple entrance.

A pair of massive doors opened silently.

Meera stepped inside, heart pounding.

The hall was lined with ancient murals.

They depicted battles against the shadow serpent.

Meera followed the murals with her fingers.

The final mural showed a girl holding a glowing orb.

Meera froze.

The girl resembled her.

Footsteps echoed behind her.

A tall priestess emerged from the shadows.

Her clothing shimmered like sunlight.

“Welcome, chosen one,” she said warmly.

Meera bowed respectfully.

“I seek guidance,” she said.

The priestess nodded.

“Then come to the altar of truth.”

She led Meera to the center of the hall.

A crystal pillar rose from the floor.

It pulsed with gentle light.

“Place your hand upon it,” said the priestess.

Meera obeyed cautiously.

The crystal glowed brighter.

Warmth surged through her arm.

The temple hummed with energy.

A deep voice filled the hall.

“Child of the river… your path is clear.”

Meera closed her eyes.

“Face the serpent without fear.”

She nodded slowly.

“Your light will weaken its shadow.”

The voice faded gently.

Meera opened her eyes.

The priestess smiled proudly.

“You are ready,” she said.

Meera felt newfound strength in her limbs.

She bowed to the priestess.

“Thank you,” she whispered.

She stepped back outside the temple.

The bird waited patiently.

“Your courage has grown,” it said.

Meera smiled faintly.

“Take me to the mountain,” she said.

The bird spread its wings.

Meera climbed aboard once again.

They soared toward the dark peaks.

The sky dimmed as they approached.

Thunder crackled in the distance.

The serpent’s roar echoed through the valley.

Meera felt her heart race.

The bird descended onto a rocky ledge.

“This is where I leave you,” it said.

Meera nodded bravely.

She walked toward a cave entrance.

Darkness seeped from within.

Meera raised her glowing palm.

Light illuminated the cave walls.

She stepped deeper inside.

The ground trembled beneath her.

A massive shape shifted in the darkness.

Two crimson eyes opened slowly.

The serpent uncoiled, scales shimmering.

Meera stood her ground.

“I am not afraid,” she whispered.

The serpent hissed, shaking the cavern.

Meera raised her hand, light bursting forth.

The serpent recoiled with a furious roar.

Shadows writhed across the walls.

Meera pushed forward, unleashing more light.

The serpent writhed in agony.

The cavern shook violently.

Light engulfed the serpent completely.

With one final roar, it vanished into smoke.

Silence filled the cavern.

Meera collapsed to her knees, exhausted.

A gentle breeze swept through the cave.

A soft voice echoed once more.

“You have restored balance.”

Meera closed her eyes in relief.

She slowly stood up.

The cave walls glowed faintly with light.

Meera walked back toward the entrance.

Dawn light spilled into the cavern.

She stepped outside, breathing deeply.

The mountains were peaceful again.

The bird circled above, singing softly.

Meera smiled, knowing her journey had just begun.

And Devgarh waited to welcome its new guardian
